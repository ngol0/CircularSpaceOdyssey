# Circular Space Odyssey

## Short description
Shoot all enemies to collect enough resources and go to next level. Be careful - the enemy can predict where you are when you move and shoot there. 

Try to get the health power-up to prevent being killed when your health are low!

There are 3 levels. First one introduces 2 basic enemy types. Second and third level will introduce a new one for each. Pay attention to each enemy's behaviors so that you can move and shoot at the right position and time!
